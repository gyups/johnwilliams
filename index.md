In September 1801, __John Williams__, a mutineer from HMS *Danae* was discovered on an American merchant ship *Statira* in Jersey and was arrested by the British. During the arrest, Williams attempted to destroy a pocketbook of papers by throwing them overboard. He was thwarted, however, when the collection of papers struck the ship's shroud and fell back onto the deck.

## The prisoner called out to one of the people, "Take care of my pocket book!"

One of the *Statira*'s crew instead picked up the book and delivered it to the authorities. From there the pocketbook was secured and sent to Portsmouth with Williams, where it was translated by Reverend William Howell because it contained French as well as English documents.

### This is a "lost" record that survived due to the diligent work of archivists.

These papers were not thrown away, misfiled, or unknown. The letterbook was described and discussed in the proceedings of Williams' court martial. It was indexed into the Admiralty in-letter system, and it was re-boxed and catalogued when British naval records were moved to the national archival collection. What makes it "lost" is that the pocketbook was never returned to the court martial proceedings. Instead, the papers where consulted by the Admiralty in 1802 due to an inquiry about Williams' legal status. When this happened, the pocketbook remained attached to this 1802 letter of inquiry, now held by the National Archives, Kew, under ADM 1/1054/774.

Though perhaps a logical filing decision at the time, this action broke the connection between the court martial and the pocketbook, making it difficult to find among the records at Kew.

__The papers digitized here are the contents of Williams' pocketbook.__

## Document Source

I found these papers on a trip to the [the National Archives, Kew](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/) in 2015 while researching the history of clothing in the Royal Navy. The list of clothing on [Williams' French inter-territorial passport](https://gyups.github.io/johnwilliams/johnwilliams/obj10/) is the reason I took photographs of these documents.

The letter and the enclosed documents, including the pocketbook, can be found by requesting box [ADM 1/1054](http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C4772137) and finding letter no. 774 (3 September 1802) when visiting Kew or making records requests online.
