In September 1801, __John Williams__, a mutineer from HMS *Danae* was discovered on an American merchant ship *Statira* in Jersey and was arrested by the British. During the arrest, Williams attempted to destroy a pocketbook of papers by throwing them overboard. He was thwarted, however, when the collection of papers struck the ship's shroud and fell back onto the deck.

## The prisoner called out to one of the people, "Take care of my pocket book!"

One of the *Statira*'s crew instead picked up the book and delivered it to the authorities. From there the pocketbook was secured and sent to Portsmouth with Williams, where it was translated by Reverend William Howell because it contained French as well as English documents.

The letterbook is known to historians of the *Danae* mutiny because it is described and discussed in the proceedings of Williams' court martial, but the book was never annexed into the papers from the trial. Instead, the papers were pulled in 1802 and filed with a letter inquiring about the status of Williams' pardon, now held by the National Archives, Kew, under ADM 1/1054/774.

__The papers digitized here are the contents of Williams' pocketbook.__

### Who was John Williams and what happened on the *Danae*?

John Williams was a quarter-gunner on the 20-gun sixth-rate *Danae*. On March 14, 1800, the vessel was overtaken by mutineers with John Williams among them. This group of primarily pressed merchant seafarers, including Americans removed from French ships, decided to sail for the nearby coast of Brittany and surrendered the ship to the French Navy. The ship's young captain, twenty-year-old Lord William Allen Proby and the loyal crew were disembarked in Le Conquet and then marched overland to Brest, where they joined the mutineers who had sailed the *Danae* to Brest with French assistance. In Brest, the loyal and mutinous sailors were kept together until Proby and his men were returned to England in a cartel out of Dunkirk in May.

The mutiny resulted in a number of court martials between 1800 and 1801, including an acquittal for Lord Proby, two hangings of Williams's colleagues, and Williams' pardon. Lord Proby was assigned command of a new ship in 1802 and sent to the Leewards Islands station. He died in August 1804, probably of yellow fever, at the age of 25 and is buried in Barbados. The *Danae*, renamed *Vaillante*, was sent to Haiti in 1802 as a transport, after which nothing more is known about its fate.

### What is so special about the *Danae* mutiny?

The mutiny of HMS *Danae* is somewhat significant because it was the only time during the French Wars period (1792-1815) when a British ship joined the French Navy. However, more broadly the *Danae* is part of the 1790s period of heightened mutinies in European navies. In Britain, the *Danae* case is overshadowed by the larger mutinies at Spithead and the Nore in the spring and summer of 1797, and the notorious single-ship case of HMS *Hermione*, whose crew butchered their officers in the evening of September 21, 1797 and delivered the ship to the Spanish in La Guaira, Venezuela.
