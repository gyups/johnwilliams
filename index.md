In September 1801, __John Williams__, a mutineer from HMS *Danae* was discovered on an American merchant ship *Statira* in Jersey and was arrested by the British. During the arrest, Williams attempted to destroy a pocketbook of papers by throwing them overboard. He was thwarted, however, when the collection of papers struck the ship's shroud and fell back onto the deck.

## The prisoner called out to one of the people, "Take care of my pocket book!"

One of the *Statira*'s crew instead picked up the book and delivered it to the authorities. From there the pocketbook was secured and sent to Portsmouth with Williams, where it was translated by Reverend William Howell because it contained French as well as English documents.

The letterbook is known to historians of the *Danae* mutiny because it is described and discussed in the proceedings of Williams' court martial, but the book was never annexed into the papers from the trial. Instead, the papers were pulled in 1802 and filed with a letter inquiring about the status of Williams' pardon, now held by the National Archives, Kew, under ADM 1/1054/774.

__The papers digitized here are the contents of Williams' pocketbook.__
