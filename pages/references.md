There hasn't been a lot of literature on the *Danae* mutiny in specific--more on the period of mutiny during the 1790s, which culminated in Britain with the mutinies at the Spithead and the Nore in 1797.

## Resources on the Mutiny on the *Danae*.

Neale, Jonathan. "Forecastle and Quarterdeck: Protest, Discipline and Mutiny in the Royal Navy, 1793-1814." PhD Diss, University of Warwick, 1990.

- Neale mentions the *Danae* (which he misnames *Diana*) only briefly to insinuate that Cpt. Proby might have been a "flogging captain" and to suggest that John Brown, a fellow sailor from *la Bordelais*, was also a former *Hermione* mutineer. John Williams is not mentioned. See p. 354-356.

Pope, Dudley. [*The Devil Himself: The Mutiny of 1800*](https://archive.org/details/devilhimselfmuti0000pope_b2a7). Alison Press, 1987.

- The longest work and only monograph focusing on the *Danae* mutiny, this book was published with a new edition in 2003. Pope takes the story seriously, visiting the French archives as well as the British and finding many of the ship's lost papers in the archive in Brittany. The book lacks detailed and at times even correct footnotes, however, and the title, drawn from something written on the records folder in France, seems to be apropos of nothing.

Spinney, J. D. "The *Danae* Mutiny". *The Mariner's Mirror* 42, no. 1 (1956): 38-53.

- A straightforward, if dated, summary of the mutiny. Spinney also remarks on the lack of the pocketbook in the court martial records.
