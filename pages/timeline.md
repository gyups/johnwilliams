The Mutiny on the *Danae* occurred on 14 March 1800 but many events occurred prior and following the mutiny. Keeping all of them straight is one of the most tricky aspects of the story, as the leading work on these events, Dudley Pope's *The Devil Himself: The Mutiny of 1800*, as a fluid sense of time. Pope's book and J.D. Spinney's article on the mutiny are the only two works that solely focus on this event.

It also doesn't help that the French side of this encounter is recorded using the Republican calendar. Dates in this form will be converted.

### 1770

##### 1770

- John Williams was born this year or the next, according to his history.[^1]

##### 1776

- __July 4__: Thirteen British colonies declare their independence from the empire.

### 1780

##### 1789

- Williams left the employment of E. Persons.[^1] Perhaps this was the merchant Ebenezer Parsons of Boston, who shipped goods around the Atlantic, and also funded some privateering ventures.[^7]

- He joins the Dunkirk fishery after leaving Boston, meaning he would have been in France during the early years of the French Revolution, after having grown up during the American Revolution.[^1]

- __July 14__: The storming of the Bastille in France marks the beginning of the French Revolution.

### 1790

##### 1793

- Williams left the Dunkirk fishery to join the "French service".[^1]

##### 1799

- He then left French service.[^1]

- Williams also married a French woman in Bordeaux.[^1]

- __September 30__: Williams is issued a passport in Bayonne by the Principal Marine Commissary Brisport to sail on the privateer *la Bourdelais*.[^2]

- __October 11__: The corsair *la Bourdelais* was captured by MHS *Revolutionaire*.

- __October 13__: Captain Twysden of *Revolutionaire* offered six men to the *Danae* whom were apparently questioned by one of the ship's lieutenants. The six men transferred were the Virginians John Brown and Samuel Scarborough, the South Carolinian David Greig, the Frenchman Charles Goodrough, and Bostonian John Williams. This is the start of Williams' time on board the *Danae*.

### 1800

##### 1800

- __March 14__: Between 9:15pm and 9:30pm, Captain Lord Allen Proby was locked bellow with the loyal crew and the arms chest on the deck above. __The Mutiny on the *Danae* had begun off the island of Ushant.__ Unable to argue terms with the mutineers, Proby threw important documents overboard, as was protocol.[^4]

- __March 15__: The the mutineers sailed towards a French convoy and John Williams hailed the *Colombe* in French. A boat was launched and French sailors came aboard. Lord Proby surrendered the ship to Captain Julien, specifically refusing to acknowledge the mutineers.[^3] The *Danae* was formerly captured by the French and landed in Le Conquet, Finistère, after slipping away from HMS *Triton* and *Boadicea*.[^4]

- __March 16__: The Mutineers sailed *Danae* to Brest joined by a French crew. The loyal British crew was marched to Brest overland. Both were kept together in Dinan prison awaiting their fates, though the mutineers were allowed more freedoms. There is some disagreement over whether the mutineers were forced to march with the loyalists. Certainly, the reports of the *Naval Chronicle* seem to revel in the lack of appreciation shown by the French but it does seem that the French were only selective in these humiliations.[^4]

- __March 18__: Proby is permitted to send a letter to the Admiralty relating the circumstances of the mutiny, which is later referenced in his court martial.[^4]

- __March 21__: Orders sent to Najac, Commissionery of the Navy at Brest from the Minister of Marine at Paris, to send the chief mutineers to Paris.[^4]

- __March 23__:A few of the mutineers were sent to Paris, including John Williams. Najac's letters and records in Brest confirm the men were sent and so does the Parisian Passport he received to travel to Bordeaux.[^4] [^8]

- The rest of the mutineer were given money and passports and allowed to live in France. Though the navy refused to accept them as sailors, some were drafted into the Légion Nantaise de l'Armée de la Républic, namely the Irishmen John Brown, Richard Galvin, and David Murphy. The loyal crew and officers were sent to the French POW camp at Valanciennes to await either an exchange or parole, but Proby and his clerk were almost immediately returned to England.

- __March 26__: Proby and his clerk, Mr. Giles, landed in a cartel from Morlaix at Plymouth.[^4]

- __March 28__: Jackson embarked at Bordeaux on board a privateer *le Brave* as a topman. The ship was nearly captured by HMS *Anson* a month later and afterwards Jackson drops from the historical records (Spinney, 50;[^5] Naval Chronicle vol. 3, 498[^4]).

- __April 12__: *The Naval Chronicle* claimed Proby and his clerk were returned on March 26 but later suggests that Proby and the officers were supposed to be return on this date but the ship sent to Brest to take them was not allowed to land. I do not know if this means that only Mr. Giles was landed on the 26th.[^4]

- __May 30__: Two mutineers taken out of cartel and sent aboard the *Cambridge* off Homoaze.[^4]

- __June 12__: HMS *Indefatidable* captured the privateer *le Vengeur* two days out of Bordeaux, with mutineer John Marret on board (Spinney, 50).

- __June 17__: Proby was court martialled on board HMS *Gladiator* in Portsmouth by Adms. Parker and Halloway, and Cpts. Thormborough, Murray, Darby, Pickmore, Tyler, Sir Williams, Yorke, Wolley, Graves, and Chuch, and Mr. Gretham, judge advocate. He is honourably acquitted.[^4]

- __August 24__: Marret was discovered in Mill Prison by Lieutenant Niven, spotted during an identity parade. The Lieutenant was actively searching the prisons and hulks for *Danae* mutineers (Spinney, 50).

- __September 2__: Marret was tried, found guilty, and hung a week later on HMS *Pique* in Plymouth (Spinney, 50).

- __November__: *La Bellone* lost most of its crew of the coast of Portugal, on which was rumoured to be some *Danae* mutineers (NC vol 4, 340).

##### 1801

- __January 30__: Williams is appointed the procurator for Richard Calvin and John Murphy in a case to get their sure of the *Danae* prize money. The official document in the pocketbook also shows that Williams and the two other men were staying at the barracks of the fort of the Revolution in Bourdeaux.[^12]

- __February 21__: John Brown and Samuel Scarborough committed to pay Williams 180 Francs

- __March__: *La Grande Mouche* was driven ashore off Spain by HMS *Diamond*, a ship that again was rumoured to have *Danae* mutineers on board. Again, the *Naval Chronicle* seemed to really relish the idea of the mutineers coming to tragedy (NC vol 4, 340).

- __June 3__: Having arrived in London on board the American schooner *Bilboa*, MacDonald was discovered in Wapping, again by Lieutenant Niven. Upon arrest, MacDonald blurted out that the Mutiny was "all Lord Proby's fault". Spinney wondered if Lt. Niven coming across him was as much a coincidence as the Naval Chronicle suggests (Spinney, 50-51; Naval Chronicle vol. 5, 533; TNA CM).

- __June 10__: Macdonald was tried at Sheerness, where he claimed to be American Samuel Higgins and only mistaken for MacDonald but due to his exclamation this was not taken seriously. Still, he tried to say he met other mutineers in Bordeaux. He submitted a US protection pass like Williams, from Lisbon, but his supposed hometown of Hadden, Connecticut, disowned him. This must have come later (Spinney, 51).

- __August 8/9__: The arrest of John Williams on board the *Statira* in Jersey. Went confronted, Williams hid bellow but Nicholas Kortright, the master of transport who came to arrest him, made it clear he knew Williams was there and wouldn't leave without him. Williams gave up but tried to destroy his pocketbook by throwing it overboard. The book hit the ship's shroud and fell back on deck, thus surviving to be pictured on this website.

- Between the arrest and trial, Williams wrote the defence of his actions during the mutiny and his life history.

- __September 12__: Williams was court martialled on board the *Gladiator* in Portsmouth and also sentenced to death.

- At some point between September 1801 and 1802, John Williams was recommended for pardon by the First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord St. Vincent and was pardoned by King George III (ADM 2/1120). At this point either Williams was put in a prison hulk or released.

##### 1802

- __September 2__: Captain P. T. Bover wrote to Admiral Mark Milbanke to answer an inquiry about a man in prison on board his ship, John Williams.[^9]

- __September 3__: Admiral Milbanke wrote to the Admiralty to inquire about the status of Williams, forwarding Bover's letter.[^11]

- __September 4__: The Board of Admiralty met. According to the minute, the board did not remember they had pardoned Williams ("Has he not been tried by a Court Martial & Condemned?") and this is probably why the papers appended to the court martial were consulted, including the pocketbook. However, this suggests that Lord St. Vincent had forgotten that he pardoned a mutinous sailor, which, for someone like him, seems unlikely.[^11]

- __September 29__: The summary of the case was submitted, based on a review of the appended documents removed from the court martial. As the court martial did not contain the pardon [?], this information must have been drawn from somewhere else. In any case, they returned the appended papers with Milbanke's letter instead of the original court martial.[^10]
