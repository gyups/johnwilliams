The Mutiny on the *Danae* occurred on 14 March 1800 but many events occurred prior and following the mutiny. Keeping all of them straight is one of the most tricky aspects of the story, as the leading work on these events, Dudley Pope's *The Devil Himself: The Mutiny of 1800*, as a fluid sense of time. Pope's book and J.D. Spinney's article on the mutiny are the only two works that solely focus on this event.

It also doesn't help that the French side of this encounter is recorded using the Republican calendar. Dates in this form will be converted.

#### 1770

- John Williams was born this year or the last, according to his protection papers. His pass from Bayonne from 1799 says he was 29 ([TNA ADM 1/1054, Bayonne Pass](https://gyups.github.io/johnwilliams/transcriptions/passport_bayonne/])) and those from Bourdeaux in 1801 say he was 32 ([ADM 1/1054, Bordeaux Passes](https://gyups.github.io/johnwilliams/transcriptions/passport_us)), suggesting he was probably born in late 1769 or early 1770.

#### 1776

- __July 4__: Thirteen British colonies declare their independence from the empire.

#### 1779

- __Jun 19__: William Allen Proby was born. He was the first son of John Proby, at the time 2nd Baron of Carysford, later 1st Earl of Carysford, and his first wife Elizabeth Osbourne.

#### 1789

- Williams left the employment of E. Persons when he was about 19 ([TNA ADM 1/1054, Statement of Case](https://gyups.github.io/johnwilliams/transcriptions/defence_auto/)). Perhaps this was the merchant Ebenezer Parsons of Boston, who shipped goods around the Atlantic, and also funded some privateering ventures.[^7]

- After leaving Parsons, he "since saild [sic] out of Different parts of America and for some years before this present war begun I saild out of Dunkirk in the South to fishery" ([TNA ADM 1/1054, Statment of Case](https://gyups.github.io/johnwilliams/transcriptions/defence_auto/)). Bopping around the Atlantic was fairly common for seafarers at this time. Ships moving across the sea, transporting people, ideas, and goods, has led historians to term this milieu "The Atlantic World".

- William Proby was allowed to style himself *Lord Proby* when his father was made Earl of Carysford, an Irish peerage that is now extinct.

- __July 14__: The storming of the Bastille in France marked the beginning of the French Revolution.

#### 1793

- Williams said "since the war have the Greatest Part of my time Been in the French service" ([TNA ADM 1/1054, Statment of Case](https://gyups.github.io/johnwilliams/transcriptions/defence_auto/)). For the British, the beginning of the war was 1793 but the French had been at war with continental European states prior to Britain's entry, so it is difficult to say what he meant. As to what he was doing, I think he means that he worked predominately in French ships after the war started.

- Proby joined the Royal Navy, becoming a midshipman at age 14 ([Pope](https://gyups.github.io/johnwilliams/transcriptions/devil_himself/), p.5).

#### 1796

- The French begin to design and build the corvette *la Vaillante* in Bayonne ([Pope](https://gyups.github.io/johnwilliams/transcriptions/devil_himself/), p.10-11).

- __March 1__: Proby passed his lieutenant's exam at age 16 ([Pope](https://gyups.github.io/johnwilliams/transcriptions/devil_himself/), p.6).

- __September 27__: While serving under John Jervis, Lord St. Vincent (who would be First Lord of the Admiralty when Williams' papers were presented to the board) in the Mediterranean, Proby is given command of his first ship, the eternally leaky HMS *Tarleton* ([Pope](https://gyups.github.io/johnwilliams/transcriptions/devil_himself/), p.7).

- __November 11__: Proby was removed from *Tarleton* and sent to HMS *Peterel* in an officer shuffle to staff the recently captured Spanish frigate *la Mahonessa*. Due to the rating of the ship, this automatically promotes Proby to Commander at 17 ([Pope](https://gyups.github.io/johnwilliams/transcriptions/devil_himself/), p.7-8).

- __November 25__: Hull and rigging finally completed, *la Vaillante* sailed for Rochefort ([Pope](https://gyups.github.io/johnwilliams/transcriptions/devil_himself/), p.11).

- __December 2__: *La Vaillante* arrived at Rochefort to receive its cannon and wait for a captain ([Pope](https://gyups.github.io/johnwilliams/transcriptions/devil_himself/), p.11).

#### 1797

- Williams married a Frenchwoman from Bourdeaux ([TNA ADM 1/1054](https://gyups.github.io/johnwilliams/transcriptions/defence_auto/)). Williams wrote: "[I] have been married in Bourdeaux in France for this [sic] five years" and since his statement was written in 1801, this would mean his marriage was around 1797.

- __April 16__: The mutiny at Spithead began in the Channel fleet when 16 ships protested against the living condition in the Royal Navy, including their meagre pay (no pay raise for nearly a century, what they did get was always late), better food, increased shore leave (fear of desertion kept men on ships even when in port), unpopular officers, and worker's comp.

- __April 26__: More ships in Plymouth join the mutiny at Spithead.

- __May 12__: A new munity broke out at the Nore, a mooring in the Thames estuary, starting on the *Sandwich* and spreading to other ships. More revolutionary in sentiment and able to harass trade into London, this mutiny was not looked on as positively as the first, which was barely tolerated.

- __May 15__: The mutiny at Spithead ended with the pardon of the mutineers and a settlement of many of their demands.

- __May 30__: The captain of HMS *Clyde* regained control of his vessel at the Nore and they slipped away to the dockyard at Sheerness. This signalled the dissolution of the mutiny. Many of the Nore leaders were tried on board HMS *Neptune* and where either hung on the *Sandwich* or transported to Australia. Still, proportionally few men where punished for this mutiny, though the reprisals were more severe than at Spithead.

- __September 4__: The Coup of 18 Fructidor, Year V, was a triggered by the results of that year's elections, which returned a majority of royalist members. Many of  those arrested were deported to French overseas colonies.

- __September 21__: The crew of HMS *Hermione* mutinied in the Caribbean, forcing their way into the quarterdeck and murdering Cpt. Hugh Pigot. These core mutineers went on to murder eight other officers and two midshipmen, throwing all the bodies overboard. The mutiny was uncommonly brutal, probably due of a combination of Pigot's cruelty and many years serving the West Indies, witnessing the constant surge of disease and the miserable dehumanization of slavery. The sailors delivered the ship to the Spanish at La Guaira and became the *Santa Cecillia*. The British were much more vindictive in finding and prosecuting the mutineers, finding 33, most of whom were hung or transported.

- __September 23__: Political déportés from the Coup of 18 Fructidor embarked on *La Vaillant*, bound for Cayenne, French Guiana, including [François Barthélemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois-Marie,_marquis_de_Barth%C3%A9lemy) and [General Charles Pichegru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Charles_Pichegru). Sometime between the coup and the arrival of the déportés, Lieutenant de vaisseau Pierre LaPorte was given command and joined the ship.They set sail for Cayenne three days later ([Pope](https://gyups.github.io/johnwilliams/transcriptions/devil_himself/), p.12,15).

- __November 11__: *La Vaillant* and the déportés arrived in Cayenne ([Pope](https://gyups.github.io/johnwilliams/transcriptions/devil_himself/), p.16).

#### 1798

- LaPorte wrote a special report to the French government on how pleased he was with *la Vaillant*'s speed and sailing qualities ([Pope](https://gyups.github.io/johnwilliams/transcriptions/devil_himself/), p.16-17).

- __Febraury 17__: Proby was sent back to the Channel from the Mediterranean and given command of the laid up  36-gun frigate HMS *Belle Poule*. Even though it was out of commission, the transfer automatically promoted Proby to post captain. He was 18 and due to seniority and the attrition of the war, would have guaranteed Proby a future as an admiral ([Pope](https://gyups.github.io/johnwilliams/transcriptions/devil_himself/), p.8-9).

- __August 3__: *La Vaillant* received orders to board more déportés bound for exile in Cayenne and left on the 6th ([Pope](https://gyups.github.io/johnwilliams/transcriptions/devil_himself/), p.17-18).

- __August 7__: HMS *Indefatigable* spots masts on the horizon and gives chase ([Pope](https://gyups.github.io/johnwilliams/transcriptions/devil_himself/), p.21).

- __August 8__: Despite wetting the sails and throwing the ship's over overboard, *la Vaillant* was unable to outrun *Indefatigable*, which fired upon the smaller ship. The French officers surrendered and the déportés were rescued from exile in French Guiana, though some were families going to join men already there and were unlikely to be reunited. *La Vaillant* was a prize of the British sent to Plymouth ([Pope](https://gyups.github.io/johnwilliams/transcriptions/devil_himself/), p.22-23).

- __September__: *La Vaillant* was renamed HMS *Danae* and the ship was retrofitted from a corvette to a frigate. The ship's twenty 8-pounders (17 tons) were replaced with twenty 32-pounder carronades, twelve 12-pounder carronades, and two 6-pounders (21 tons), all on the main deck, plus 10 more tons in the shot locker. As Dudley Pope remarked "the effect on the fine-lined *Danae* was like using a racehorse in a dungcart" ([Pope](https://gyups.github.io/johnwilliams/transcriptions/devil_himself/), p.25). This was apparently the British approach to converting French corvettes into Royal Navy service: "more guns; fewer men".

- __September 20__: *Danae* received its first sailors, one of whom deserted nine days later ([Pope](https://gyups.github.io/johnwilliams/transcriptions/devil_himself/), p.27).

- __December 4__: Proby is given command of HMS *Danae*, his first real command as captain and joining the Channel blockade ([Pope](https://gyups.github.io/johnwilliams/transcriptions/devil_himself/), p.9,28).

- __December 12__: Proby joined the ship and read out his commission to the so-far assembled crew, beginning their sea wages.

#### 1799

- __September 30__: Williams is issued a passport in Bayonne by the Principal Marine Commissary Brisport to sail on the privateer *la Bourdelais* ([TNA ADM 1/1054, Marine Passport from Bayonne](https://gyups.github.io/johnwilliams/transcriptions/passport_bayonne/)).

- __October 11__: The corsair *la Bourdelais* was captured by HMS *Revolutionaire*.

- __October 13__: Captain Twysden of *Revolutionaire* offered six men to the *Danae* whom were apparently questioned by one of the ship's lieutenants. The six men transferred were the Virginians John Brown and Samuel Scarborough, the South Carolinian David Greig, the Frenchman Charles Goodrough, and Bostonian John Williams. This is the start of Williams' time on board the *Danae*.

#### 1800

- __March 14__: Between 9:15pm and 9:30pm, Captain Lord Proby was locked bellow with the loyal crew and the arms chest on the deck above. __The Mutiny on the *Danae* had begun off the island of Ushant.__ Unable to argue terms with the mutineers, Proby threw important documents overboard, as was protocol.[^4]

- __March 15__: The the mutineers sailed towards a French convoy and John Williams hailed the *Colombe* in French. A boat was launched and French sailors came aboard. Lord Proby surrendered the ship to Captain Julien, specifically refusing to acknowledge the mutineers.[^3] The *Danae* was formerly captured by the French and landed in Le Conquet, Finistère, after slipping away from HMS *Triton* and *Boadicea*.[^4]

- __March 16__: The Mutineers sailed *Danae* to Brest joined by a French crew. The loyal British crew was marched to Brest overland. Both were kept together in Dinan prison awaiting their fates, though the mutineers were allowed more freedoms. There is some disagreement over whether the mutineers were forced to march with the loyalists. Certainly, the reports of the *Naval Chronicle* seem to revel in the lack of appreciation shown by the French but it does seem that the French were only selective in these humiliations.[^4]

- __March 18__: Proby is permitted to send a letter to the Admiralty relating the circumstances of the mutiny, which is later referenced in his court martial.[^4]

- __March 21__: Orders sent to Najac, Commissionery of the Navy at Brest from the Minister of Marine at Paris, to send the chief mutineers to Paris.[^4]

- __March 23__:A few of the mutineers were sent to Paris, including John Williams. Najac's letters and records in Brest confirm the men were sent and so does the Parisian Passport he received to travel to Bordeaux.[^4] [^8]

- The rest of the mutineer were given money and passports and allowed to live in France. Though the navy refused to accept them as sailors, some were drafted into the Légion Nantaise de l'Armée de la Républic, namely the Irishmen John Brown, Richard Galvin, and David Murphy. The loyal crew and officers were sent to the French POW camp at Valanciennes to await either an exchange or parole, but Proby and his clerk were almost immediately returned to England.

- __March 26__: Proby and his clerk, Mr. Giles, landed in a cartel from Morlaix at Plymouth.[^4]

- __March 28__: Jackson embarked at Bordeaux on board a privateer *le Brave* as a topman. The ship was nearly captured by HMS *Anson* a month later and afterwards Jackson drops from the historical records (Spinney, 50;[^5] Naval Chronicle vol. 3, 498[^4]).

- __April 12__: *The Naval Chronicle* claimed Proby and his clerk were returned on March 26 but later suggests that Proby and the officers were supposed to be return on this date but the ship sent to Brest to take them was not allowed to land. I do not know if this means that only Mr. Giles was landed on the 26th.[^4]

- __May 30__: Two mutineers taken out of cartel and sent aboard the *Cambridge* off Homoaze.[^4]

- __June 12__: HMS *Indefatigable* captured the privateer *le Vengeur* two days out of Bordeaux, with mutineer John Marret on board (Spinney, 50).

- __June 17__: Proby was court martialled on board HMS *Gladiator* in Portsmouth by Adms. Parker and Halloway, and Cpts. Thormborough, Murray, Darby, Pickmore, Tyler, Sir Williams, Yorke, Wolley, Graves, and Chuch, and Mr. Gretham, judge advocate. He is honourably acquitted.[^4]

- __August 24__: Marret was discovered in Mill Prison by Lieutenant Niven, spotted during an identity parade. The Lieutenant was actively searching the prisons and hulks for *Danae* mutineers (Spinney, 50).

- __September 2__: Marret was tried, found guilty, and hung a week later on HMS *Pique* in Plymouth (Spinney, 50).

- __November__: *La Bellone* lost most of its crew of the coast of Portugal, on which was rumoured to be some *Danae* mutineers (NC vol 4, 340).

#### 1801

- __January 30__: Williams is appointed the procurator for Richard Calvin and John Murphy in a case to get their sure of the *Danae* prize money. The official document in the pocketbook also shows that Williams and the two other men were staying at the barracks of the fort of the Revolution in Bourdeaux.[^12]

- __February 21__: John Brown and Samuel Scarborough committed to pay Williams 180 Francs

- __March__: *La Grande Mouche* was driven ashore off Spain by HMS *Diamond*, a ship that again was rumoured to have *Danae* mutineers on board. Again, the *Naval Chronicle* seemed to really relish the idea of the mutineers coming to tragedy (NC vol 4, 340).

- __April 23__: Consul Isaac Cox Barnet of Bordeaux wrote US protection passes for John Williams in English and French. On the French pass, he notes that Williams intended to join *la Statira* at Paimpot with Cpt. Gardner, who was formerly assosiated

- __June 3__: Having arrived in London on board the American schooner *Bilboa*, MacDonald was discovered in Wapping, again by Lieutenant Niven. Upon arrest, MacDonald blurted out that the Mutiny was "all Lord Proby's fault". Spinney wondered if Lt. Niven coming across him was as much a coincidence as the Naval Chronicle suggests (Spinney, 50-51; Naval Chronicle vol. 5, 533; TNA CM).

- __June 10__: Macdonald was tried at Sheerness, where he claimed to be American Samuel Higgins and only mistaken for MacDonald but due to his exclamation this was not taken seriously. Still, he tried to say he met other mutineers in Bordeaux. He submitted a US protection pass like Williams, from Lisbon, but his supposed hometown of Hadden, Connecticut, disowned him. This must have come later (Spinney, 51).

- __August 8/9__: The arrest of John Williams on board the *Statira* in Jersey. Went confronted, Williams hid bellow but Nicholas Kortright, the master of transport who came to arrest him, made it clear he knew Williams was there and wouldn't leave without him. Williams gave up but tried to destroy his pocketbook by throwing it overboard. The book hit the ship's shroud and fell back on deck, thus surviving to be pictured on this website.

- Between the arrest and trial, Williams wrote the defence of his actions during the mutiny and his life history.

- __September 12__: Williams was court martialled on board the *Gladiator* in Portsmouth and also sentenced to death.

- At some point between September 1801 and 1802, John Williams was recommended for pardon by the First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord St. Vincent and was pardoned by King George III (ADM 2/1120). At this point either Williams was put in a prison hulk or released.

#### 1802

- __September 2__: Captain P. T. Bover wrote to Admiral Mark Milbanke to answer an inquiry about a man in prison on board his ship, John Williams.[^9]

- __September 3__: Admiral Milbanke wrote to the Admiralty to inquire about the status of Williams, forwarding Bover's letter.[^11]

- __September 4__: The Board of Admiralty met. According to the minute, the board did not remember they had pardoned Williams ("Has he not been tried by a Court Martial & Condemned?") and this is probably why the papers appended to the court martial were consulted, including the pocketbook. However, this suggests that Lord St. Vincent had forgotten that he pardoned a mutinous sailor, which, for someone like him, seems unlikely.[^11]

- __September 29__: The summary of the case was submitted, based on a review of the appended documents removed from the court martial. As the court martial did not contain the pardon [?], this information must have been drawn from somewhere else. In any case, they returned the appended papers with Milbanke's letter instead of the original court martial.[^10]
