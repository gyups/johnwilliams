__HMS *Danae* (formerly *La Vaillant*)__

__Jackson__  
Captain of the foretop and native of Liverpool. A mutineer. According to the *Naval Chronicle*, Jackson was the secretary to Richard Parker, the principal mutineer at the Nore in 1797.

__John Williams__  
The 29-year-old Bostonian who, according to him, lived a considerable portion of his life in France or working with Frenchmen. It is confirmed by both accounts of the mutiny and the records of displayed on this website that Williams could read and write in French, and was familiar with French bureaucracy and law. He may have been a Channel Islander, but that is never proposed by any contemporary commentator on the mutiny or modern historian.

__Captain Lord John Allen Proby__  
Son of Lord Carysford, he joined the Royal Navy when he was 14 and passed his lieutenants' exam at 16. He temporarily commanded several ships before taking command of the *Danae*. He was 20 when the mutiny occurred. After being cartelled back to Britain as part of a typical POW exchange, Proby was court martialled and aquitted for the loss of his ship. He ran for and won a seat in the House of Commons, sitting in 1803, before being offered a new ship HMS *Amelia*. He sailed for Barbados and was sent on to Suriname, a Dutch colony in South American and yellow fever hotbed. On return to Barbados, Proby came down with yellow fever, along with his crew. He died in October 1804 and is buried in Bridgetown.

__*La Colombe*__  
The French warship that captured the *Danae*.

__Mr. Giles__  
Proby's clerk. This man was a professional scribe and bureaucrat who would have written letters for Proby, among other concerns. Many extant letters of Proby's from *Danae* were probably written by Giles and signed by Proby.

__MacDonald, aka Samuel Higgins__  
Mutineer from the *Danae* who claimed to be Samuel Higgins from Holden, Conn., on discovery. He was tried on June 10, 1801, and hung shortly after.
