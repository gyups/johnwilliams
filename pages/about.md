This website is the fruit of a four-day course called Minimal Computing held June 14-17, 2021, by *Dream Lab: A Digital Humanities Training Institute*, *Price Lab for Digital Humanities*, and *Penn Libraries*. The course was taught by Alex Gil and Marii Nyr√∂p with the hope to empower researchers to put and maintain their own work online.

This site currently hosts IIIF images of the pocketbook of John Williams, quarter-gunner and mutineer. In the future, I may add some other interesting papers.
