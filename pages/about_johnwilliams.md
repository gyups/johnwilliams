__Who was John Williams and what happened on the *Danae*?__

John Williams was a quarter-gunner on the 20-gun sixth-rate *Danae*. On March 14, 1800, the vessel was overtaken by mutineers with John Williams among them. This group of primarily pressed merchant seafarers, including Americans removed from French ships, decided to sail for the nearby coast of Brittany and surrendered the ship to the French Navy. The ship's young captain, twenty-year-old Lord William Allen Proby and the loyal crew were disembarked in Le Conquet and then marched overland to Brest, where they joined the mutineers who had sailed the *Danae* to Brest with French assistance. In Brest, the loyal and mutinous sailors were kept together until Proby and his men were returned to England in a cartel out of Dunkirk in May.

__What is the deal with the *Danae*?__

The ship on which the *Danae* mutiny took place was originally a French corvette called *La Vaillante*. It was built in Bayonne in 1796 and was designed for speed with a flush deck and capable of carrying 20 4-pound guns. Siginificantly for the mutiny, the ship was "ruthlessly" small, with the captain's quarters barely 5 feet: "a cramped henhouse."[^1] *La Vaillante* was launched and ordered to transport *déportés* from the *coup d'état* of 18 Fructidor to Cayenne. After a handful of such trips, *La Vaillante* was captured by HMS *Indefatigable* on August 7, 1798.

The corvette was surveilled in Plymouth to give a prize amount to the officers and crew of *Indefatigable* and it was renamed *Danae*. Its twenty 4-pound French guns were replaced by twenty 32-pound cannonades, twelve 12-pound cannonades, and two 6-pounders fixed to the maindeck, adding new weight higher in the small ship. The *Danae* was a difficult ship to sail under the British: top-heavy, uncomfortable, and interminably short-staffed.

__What were the causes of the mutiny?__

The captain, Lord Proby, was twenty-years-old when he was given command of the ship and had to deal with unique problems that were not mitigated by the ship's small size. Too slow to capture prizes, the *Danae* frustrated Proby's ambitions as he cruised the Channel looking for French ships that challenged the Royal Navy blockade. When they did capture ships, or joined British ships with prizes, Proby's loyal crewmembers often had to be sent to sail the ships back to Britain. As the *Danae*'s time at sea lengthened, Proby increasing found his ship short-staffed and he drew new crewmembers from the crews of captured ships. On October 13, 1799, Proby received six Americans from HMS *La Revolutionaire* who had been taken off a French ship *Bordelais*. John Williams was among them.

The *Danae* was lacking in its most skilled seafarers, top-men who worked in the rigging at the highest points of a vessel's masts. These men consequently also carried a lot of authority, vested in them by their dangerous, manly labour and their seafaring skill. Proby allowed pressed men to work as top-men, and it appears that they used their powerful place in the ship's labour hierarchy to both organize a plan of mutiny and to keep that news from reaching anyone who might report them to the officers.

Further, Proby's space problem caused him to stow the ship's arms chest on deck rather than in his quarters. The mutineers were sure to secure the key to the chest in order to arm themselves.

On March 14, 1800, a group of mutineers seized the master and forced him below. They closed and locked the hatches, trapping the officers and marines below and any loyal men above. This was the start of the mutiny on the *Danae*.

__What is so special about the *Danae* mutiny?__

The mutiny of HMS *Danae* is somewhat significant because it was the only time during the French Wars period (1792-1815) when a British ship joined the French Navy. However, more broadly the *Danae* is part of the 1790s period of heightened mutinies in European navies. In Britain, the *Danae* case is overshadowed by the larger mutinies at Spithead and the Nore in the spring and summer of 1797, and the notorious single-ship case of HMS *Hermione*, whose crew butchered their officers in the evening of September 21, 1797 and delivered the ship to the Spanish in La Guaira, Venezuela.

__Consequences of the Mutiny__

The mutiny resulted in a number of court martials between 1800 and 1801, including an acquittal for Lord Proby, two hangings of Williams's colleagues, and Williams' pardon. Lord Proby was assigned command of a new ship in 1802 and sent to the Leewards Islands station. He died in August 1804, probably of yellow fever, at the age of 25 and is buried in Barbados. The *Danae*, renamed *La Vaillante*, was sent to Haiti in 1802 as a transport, after which nothing more is known about its fate.

John Williams was pardoned in 1801 but what happened to him afterwards is not known at this time.
