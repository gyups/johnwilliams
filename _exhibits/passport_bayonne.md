## Notes

[^1]: The corsair *Le Bourdelais* was a privateer from Bordeaux (hence the name) that was captured by HMS *Revolutionaire* on 11 October 1799. John Williams and five other men aboard were pressed into British service and transferred to HMS *Danae*. The circumstances of Captains Proby and Twysden's belief that these men were English and neither French nor American, as they claimed, was the crux of Williams' case and his pardon.

[^2]: The document must have been ripped with Rev. Howell got it because he also does not translate Williams' height.

[^3]: This refers to the complimentary days or sanscullotides. These days were intended to be both a celebration of the revolution at the end of year (in the fall rather than after Christmas) and to add days needed to square a logical calendar to the earth's rotation.
