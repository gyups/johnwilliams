## Notes

[^1]: This is the number of the documents within the pocketbook, numbered by Rev. Howell.

[^2]: The corsaire *La Mouche* was purchased or captured by Gorge Gardner. The parameters of this note suggest that Gardner expected to repay Williams on the earnings from *La Mouche*, which was operating as a privateer by the Citoyen La Prée.

[^3]: Gorge Gardner was another former American operating in France. He and men like John Williams were likely attracted to the country at this time because of its political flux. There was an opportunity for American seafarers acting as quasi merchants & privateers to make money running the British blockades. Gardner owned the ship *Statira*, on which Williams was later arrested by the British government in Jersey.
