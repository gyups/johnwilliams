Case of John Williams

It appears by the Minutes of the Court Martial that he was born at Boston in New England (at least no proof is brought to the contrary) and that he married a French woman at Bordeaux about five years ago.
That he was taken on board the *Bordelais* French Privateer serving as part of the Crew, by the *Revolutionaire*.

That Lord Proby (while the Prisoners were on board the *Revolutionaire*) had ordered a Lieutenant to propose to Williams that he and four or five others should be received as volunteers on board the *Danae*, instead of being sent to Prison, and that they had accepted the [page 2] offer, telling the Lieutenant, that they had been brought into the French Service against their inclination and were ready to enter into the English; but the conversation was not given in Evidence by the Lieutenant nor any other person that heard it.

<h2>Pages Two and Three of the Case Summary</h2>

The Law Officers of the Crown on considering all the proceedings have repeated their opinion that this hearsay Evidence of Lord Proby had been improperly received by the Court, and, <del>though</del> as the chief point on which a decision on the Case should be formed, is <u>whether the Prisoners did or did not voluntarily enter to serve on board</u> [page 3] the <em>Danae</em>, which had not been proved by the Lieutenant or any other person who was present, the Prisoner ought to have the benefit of the irregularity, and that Williams ought therefore to be discharged, letting it be distinctly understood that it had been on that ground, and that ground only, the Evidence being clear in every other respect.
