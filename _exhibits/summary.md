Case of John Williams

It appears by the Minutes of the Court Martial that he was born at Boston in New England (at least no proof is brought to the contrary) and that he married a French woman at Bordeaux about five years ago. [^1]
That he was taken on board the *Bordelais* French Privateer serving as part of the Crew, by the *Revolutionaire*. [^2]

That Lord Proby [^3] (while the Prisoners were on board the *Revolutionaire*) had ordered a Lieutenant to propose to Williams that he and four or five others should be received as volunteers on board the *Danae*, instead of being sent to Prison, and that they had accepted the [page 2] offer, telling the Lieutenant, that they had been brought into the French Service against their inclination and were ready to enter into the English; [^4] but the conversation was not given in Evidence by the Lieutenant nor any other person that heard it.

<h2>Pages Two and Three of the Case Summary</h2>

The Law Officers of the Crown on considering all the proceedings have repeated their opinion that this hearsay Evidence of Lord Proby had been improperly received by the Court, and, <del>though</del> as the chief point on which a decision on the Case should be formed, is <u>whether the Prisoners did or did not voluntarily enter to serve on board</u> [page 3] the <em>Danae</em>, [^5] which had not been proved by the Lieutenant or any other person who was present, the Prisoner ought to have the benefit of the irregularity, and that Williams ought therefore to be discharged, letting it be distinctly understood that it had been on that ground, and that ground only, the Evidence being clear in every other respect.

__To be pardoned.__

## Notes

[^1]: This information is from Williams' defence and life history.

[^2]: HMS *Revolutionaire* was a French warship that was captured by the Royal Navy in 1794 and was captained by Thomas Twysden. On October 13, 1799, he transferred six men to the *Danae*: John Brown, Samuel Scarborough, David Greig, Charles Goodrough, and John Williams. All claimed to be Americans except Charles, who said he was French.

[^3]: Lord Proby refers to the captain of the *Danae*, Lord William Allan Proby. At the time of the mutiny, Proby was 20 years old. He was court martialled for losing his ship after he was cartelled from France in a POW exchange, and found not guilty. This was a very common occurrence for officers, who would expect to have to prove they did everything in their power to save their ships. Proby was briefly elected to Parliament but was assigned to a new ship, HMS *Amelia* in 1803 and set sail for Barbados, then on to Suriname. On his return cruise back to Barbados, the *Amelia* was struck with yellow fever and by the time they arrived in Bridgetown, several members of Proby's crew were already dead, including his surgeon and one lieutenant. Proby fell ill with the disease within the week and on 21 October 1804, he died. He was twenty-five.

[^4]: At this time it was not uncommon to have a variety of different nationalities serving in the Royal Navy -- this was occurring as the ideas of the citizen and the citizen soldier were being developed and shaped in both America and France. This was a time when someone could not change their nationality and there was no concept of regulated immigration--people simply left one country and entered another. However, countries like Britain believed that their subjects never stopped being British and therefore were fair game to press into military service at sea. Maritime workers were at the forefront of changing international laws, and would over the course of the nineteenth century become the most scrutinized and documented workers in the world.

[^5]: The issue and the reasoning for the pardon is not that Williams was American, it was that his voluntary status could not be proven in court. At this time, Williams would not have been considered an enemy combatant as the United States did not go to war with Britain until 1812. I do suspect this case was complicated by Williams' French loyalties.
