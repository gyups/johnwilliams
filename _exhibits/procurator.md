## Notes

[^1]: The document number, according to translator Rev. Howell, for when these papers were presented to the court martial.

[^2]: 10 Pluviôse Year IX = 30 January 1801

[^3]: A procurator is someone with the legal authority to represent others in court. In this case, Williams is assuming (or attempting to assume) the right to represent Richard Calvin and John Murphy in the sale of the *Danae*. This strongly suggests, among other clues and Williams' own assertions, that Williams was familiar with the French legal system and the prize court. It is likely from this that Williams was a career privateer building a career in the shadow of the British blockade of France.

[^4]: Another strike against Williams here, plainly stating he was among the men who carried *Danae* into Brest.

[^5]: Again, this document establishes that Williams not only sought to profit from the capture of the *Danae*, bringing Captain Proby's judgement to recruit him into question, and also was well-versed in the French legal system to suggest the personal history he gave at his court martial was mostly legitimate.

[^6]: 10 Pluvoise Year VII = 30 January 1799 (This appears to be a mistake, as it predates the mutiny - this official does not close the loop of the 9 so it can be interpreted as a 7).

[^7]: This is the French abbreviation for the latin *et cetera* meaning "and so on". In English it would be &c and this is commonly seen in British records of the time. There were fewer anagrams during this period but many abbreviations or replacement words that we do not use today to refer to dates (ultimo), repeat listed text (ditto), or to shorten names (Jno=John, Chas=Charles) and words (lad'e=ladite), many of which solve the burdens of virtually all document creation being handwritten, though this was about to change.
