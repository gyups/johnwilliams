### Notes

[^1]: This number refers to the numerical subject key used to organize the ADM/12 digests at the National Archives. In this case, the notation for this letter was filed under "COURTS MARTIAL; Revision of Sentences" and can be found in [ADM 12/97](http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C513829). A guide to the ADM 12 digests can be found at [here at Global Maritime History](http://globalmaritimehistory.com/research-note-adm-12-finding-aid-1800-1840/).

[^2]: Related to the previous number, this letter and number combination is the code for the location of the letter provided by the ADM 12 digests. The National Archive's modern archival system rests on the bones of the one established by clerks 200-years-ago for the Admiralty. In this system, a letter referred to boxes or bound volumes of certain letters, in this case "A" or "Letters from Commanders-in-Chief, Portsmouth". From this, the clerk would use the year of the digest and the subsequent number, referring to the file order of the box/book, to find the needed letter. In the modern system, A774 refers to [ADM 1/1054: Letters from CiC, Portsmouth; 1802, nos. 601-799](http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C4772137).

[^3]: Ultimo is shorthand for "last month" so this refers to the 30th of August.

[^4]: Evan Nepean was the First Secretary of the Admiralty and he received all correspondence for the Board of Admiralty. He served in this position from 1795 to 1804 and had only recently received his Barony in 1802. Though the Board of Admiralty would view the correspondence, captains and admirals knew to address them to Nepean, or whoever was currently the First Secretary. These conventions and other rote language in these letters probably made it very difficult for common people to address the Board outside petitions.

[^5]: Almost every letter sent to the Admiralty from this period has a note written on the folded-over bottom-right corner of the first letter. These notes are called "minutes" and are the reactions, decisions, and questions of the Board of Admiralty from the meeting where they discussed the letter. Often minutes include little more that the remark "read" but occasionally they were more verbose, like this note.

[^6]: *Vide* means "consult". The "call and response" discussion in this minute is uncommon, probably between Evan Nepean and some unknown member of the board. John Jervis, Lord St. Vincent, was the First Lord of the Admiralty between 1801 and 1804, and may be the questioner.
