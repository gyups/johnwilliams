{% include inline_image.html collection='johnwilliams' pid='obj28' %}

*Blenheim* at Spithead [^1]  
2nd September 1802  
No.3

Sir

In reply to your Letter of Yesterdays date, concerning John Williams now a Prisoner on board His Majestyâ€™s Ship under my Command[^3] and late belonging to the *Danae*; have to remark; upon interrogating him he says he was born at Boston in America, and formerly produced Testimonials to prove his Citizenship which were forwarded to the Admiralty after his Trial on board the *Gladiator*, but has none at present in his possession. [^2]

I have the honor to be  
Sir  
your most obedient  
humble Servant

P.T. Bover

### Notes

[^1]: Spithead is an important British roadstead or mooring just outside the entrance to Portsmouth. Mooring in the open water was dangerous but Spithead was sheltered to North and Northwest by the southern British coast and to the south by the Isle of Wight. There are many similar roadsteads around the world. Staying out of port kept sailors from deserting but also kept ships in a state of readiness--before steam engines, leaving port was dependent on the whims of the tide.

[^2]: Williams was tried on September 12, 1801, on board the *Gladiator*. He was declared guilty and sentenced to death. This letter suggests that Williams was still alive a year later, when this letter about his status was sent. It is likely that after his court martial, Williams was imprisoned in a prison hulk, a de-masted former warship converted to a floating prison. The POW prison at Dartmoor was not opened until 1809, though it would later hold many American sailors captured during the War of 1812.

[^3]: Perhaps Williams was released after his pardon in 1801 and went back to sea. Then he was captured again by Bover and thrown in the brig, then carried to Spithead where the captain made this inquiry.
