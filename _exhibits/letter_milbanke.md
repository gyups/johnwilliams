## The Letter

{% include inline_image.html collection='johnwilliams' pid='obj02' %}

*Blenheim* at Spithead [^1]
2nd September 1802
No.3

Sir

   In reply to your Letter of Yesterdays date, concerning John Williams now a Prisoner on board His Majestyâ€™s Ship under my Command and late belonging to the *Danae*; have to remark; upon interrogating him he says he was born at Boston in America, and formerly produced Testimonials to prove his Citizenship which were forwarded to the Admiralty after his Trial on board the *Gladiator*, but has none at present in his possession. [^2]

   I have the honor to be Sir your most obedient humble Servant

P.T. Bover

### Notes

[^1]: Spithead is an important British roadstead or mooring just outside the entrance to Portsmouth. Ships couldn't always sit in port due to space consideration and moving them around harbour was a lot more complicated and required more space before steam tugs and modern side thrusters. However, mooring in the Channel was dangerous so Spithead was sheltered to the south by the Isle of Wight. There are many similar roadsteads around the world.

[^2]: Williams was court martialed on September 12, 1801, on board the *Gladiator*. He was declared guilty and sentenced to death. This letter suggests that Williams was still alive a year later, when this letter about his status was sent.
